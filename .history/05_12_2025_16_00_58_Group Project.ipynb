    "# Introduction\n",
    "A computer science-focused research group at UBC has been collecting data concerning different statistics about how people play video games. A MineCraft server was set up in order to track data as volunteer players navigated through the MineCraft world. Variables such as played hours, age, gender, and experience level were tracked. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we are investigating **what player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how these features differ between various player types.** More specifically, we are investigating if a **player’s age, experience level, and total played hours can predict whether a player will subscribe to the newsletter.** \n",
    "\n",
    "This data and predictive analysis can help the research group identify patterns in player behaviours and tailor a game-related newsletter to a more refined group of players in order to increase subscription rates. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset (players.csv) used here provides player information which can help examine what factors are most predictive of subscribing to the newsletter, and if any of these variables overlap. Demographic and behavioural engagement variables provided in the dataset can be used to predict the class of the target variable, subscribe. "

    "### Modelling Approach: KNN Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "We use **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** to predict whether a player subscribes to the newsletter based on their `played_hours` and `Age`. KNN is a simple, interpretable classification method that makes predictions by looking at the most similar players in the training data and taking a majority vote over their subscription status. This makes it suitable for our problem, where we expect players with similar playtime and age to have similar behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN is a good fit here for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It can capture **non-linear relationships** between predictors and subscription status without explicitly specifying a functional form.\n",
    "- It **does not require strong distributional assumptions** (e.g., normality) on the predictors.\n",
    "- With only a small number of numeric predictors (`played_hours`, `Age`), the **curse of dimensionality is limited**, and distance-based similarity remains meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "We make the following assumptions when applying KNN:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Players with **similar total played hours and age** are likely to have **similar newsletter subscription behavior**.\n",
    "- The feature space is not too sparse, so each test player will have a reasonable number of similar neighbours in the training set.\n",
    "- After proper preprocessing (centering and scaling), Euclidean distance is an appropriate way to measure similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN also has important limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is **sensitive to scaling and outliers**: large differences in total played hours or age can dominate the distance calculation if predictors are not standardized.\n",
    "- The choice of **K (number of neighbours)** controls model complexity; very small K can overfit to noise, while very large K can oversmooth and underfit.\n",
    "- Prediction can be **computationally expensive** on very large datasets because distances must be computed to many training points.\n",
