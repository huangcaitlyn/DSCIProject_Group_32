    "# Introduction\n",
    "A computer science-focused research group at UBC has been collecting data concerning different statistics about how people play video games. A MineCraft server was set up in order to track data as volunteer players navigated through the MineCraft world. Variables such as played hours, age, gender, and experience level were tracked. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we are investigating **what player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how these features differ between various player types.** More specifically, we are investigating if a **player’s age, experience level, and total played hours can predict whether a player will subscribe to the newsletter.** \n",
    "\n",
    "This data and predictive analysis can help the research group identify patterns in player behaviours and tailor a game-related newsletter to a more refined group of players in order to increase subscription rates. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset (players.csv) used here provides player information which can help examine what factors are most predictive of subscribing to the newsletter, and if any of these variables overlap. Demographic and behavioural engagement variables provided in the dataset can be used to predict the class of the target variable, subscribe. "
